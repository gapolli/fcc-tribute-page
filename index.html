                &emsp;Avram Noam Chomsky (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive
                scientist, historian, social critic, and political activist. Sometimes called "the father of modern
                linguistics", Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field
                of cognitive science. He is Laureate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona and Institute
                Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and is the author of more than
                150 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with
                anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.

                &emsp;Born to Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from
                alternative bookstores in New York City. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania. During his
                postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational
                grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957
                emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played
                a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science
                Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He created or co-created the universal grammar
                theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also
                played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the
                work of B. F. Skinner.

                &emsp;An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American
                imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his anti-war essay "The Responsibility of
                Intellectuals". Becoming associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism
                and placed on President Richard Nixon's Enemies List. While expanding his work in linguistics over
                subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistics wars. In collaboration with Edward S.
                Herman, Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent and
                worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. His defense of unconditional freedom of
                speech, including that of Holocaust denial, generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of
                the 1980s. Since retiring from active teaching at MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism,
                including opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement. Chomsky began teaching
                at the University of Arizona in 2017.

                &emsp;One of the most cited scholars alive, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He
                is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences,
                contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind.
                In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy,
                neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news
                media. Chomsky and his ideas are highly influential in the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist
                movements.
